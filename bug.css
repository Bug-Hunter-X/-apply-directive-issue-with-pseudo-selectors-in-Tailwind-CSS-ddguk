This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a class that contains a pseudo-selector, such as `&:hover`.  The `@apply` directive will not correctly apply the styles for the pseudo-selector in all circumstances, particularly when combined with other directives or complex class structures. For example:
```css
/* Styles.css */
.btn {
  @apply bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded;
  &:hover {
    @apply bg-blue-700;
  }
}
```
In this case, the hover effect might not work as expected.
